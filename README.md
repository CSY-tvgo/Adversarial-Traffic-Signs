## Contents  
+ `1.CTSRD_Classification`: Train a Chinese traffic sign classification model using [CTSRD Dataset](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/trafficdata/recognition.html). It uses ResNet101 in Keras to train.  
+ `2.DARTS-Attack-on-CTSRD`: Modified [DARTS pipeline](https://github.com/inspire-group/advml-traffic-sign), it can generate adversarial Chinese traffic signs.  
+ `3.TT100K_ObjectDetection`: Using an object detection model pre-trained by [TT100K Dataset](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/traffic-sign/) to do test of adversarial traffic signs in real world.
+ `4.Examples of Adversarial Traffic Signs`: Some examples.
